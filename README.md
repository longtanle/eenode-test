# EEnode-demo
NodeJS(Express) website demos: Google Earth Engine connection and indicator retrieving !


You'll need:

```
node latest version
a service account key JSON file
```

To set the app up yourself:

```
npm install
node server
```

#How it works:


This website site is based on Moroccan data since I'm from Morocco. So you can see NDVI,MTCI,CHIRPS,LANDUSE by filling the form or by drawing a polygon or rectangle (other figure doesn't work since they aren't supported by EE I guess)
